## Feature Ideas
 * Settings page or side panel that allows changing the language and voice from a list of available voices as well as the pitch and volume

 * Category buttons that opens a new view where the first button is a back arrow, clicking the arrow will leave the category.

 * Make the buttons sortable by dragging (perhaps started from the settings page)

 * Make long press select words that will then be spoken as a sentence instead of one at a time. Move deletion of words to an even longer press.

 * On the deletion dialogue add individual settings for language, voice and pronunciation, etc.
